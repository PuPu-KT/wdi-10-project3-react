# Point-of-sale
Point of sale app component implemented with React/Redux.

This is a rough demo POS for shops and small business to build their mobile storefront.

It features a list of items in inventory, a list of items on screen, checkout and edit, and pay confirmation page.
A shopping cart is saved in user's local storage. UI and Click animation for lists and form input are inspired by current Tablet usage.

Although the application is responsive to the screen size, it is still recommended that you run the project full screen so you can see everything as the application screen is fixed, therefore no scrolling.

Please run on a newer modern version of Chrome as it was developed on this browser.
